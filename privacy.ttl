### The Following Seven Classes are derived from Finn's Privacy model.

	rdfs:comment "Parent class for the seven types of privacy from Finn's model"^^xsd:string ;
	rdfs:label "Privacy Type"^^xsd:string .

privacy:PersonalPrivacy
	rdf:type rdfs:Class ;
	rdfs:comment "Privacy of the person encompasses the right to keep body functions and body characteristics (such as genetic codes and biometrics) private."^^xsd:string ;
	rdfs:label "Privacy of the Person"^^xsd:string ;
	rdfs:subClassOf privacy:PrivacyType.

privacy:BehaviourAndActionPrivacy
	rdf:type rdfs:Class ;
	rdfs:comment "The ability to behave in public, semi-public or one’s private space without having actions monitored or controlled by others con- tributes to the development and exercise of autonomy and freedom in thought and action."^^xsd:string ;
	rdfs:label "Privacy of Behaviour and Action"^^xsd:string ;
	rdfs:subClassOf privacy:PrivacyType.

privacy:CommunicationPrivacy
rdf:type rdfs:Class ;

privacy:LocationAndSpacePrivacy
rdf:type rdfs:Class ;

privacy:Motive
	rdf:type rdfs:Class ;
